# Diff guard for multi-agent command translation
# Satisfies: RT-11 (Claude/AMP output unchanged), B2 (backward compatibility)
#
# Ensures:
# 1. Pre-built Gemini .toml and Codex SKILL.md files match canonical .md source
# 2. Parallel library bundle is up-to-date
# 3. Claude Code/AMP receive exact copies of canonical .md (no translation drift)
