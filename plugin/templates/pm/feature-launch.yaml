# CONSTRAINTS - Customize these for your specific feature launch
# =============================================================================

constraints:
  business:
    - id: B1
      type: invariant
      statement: "Feature must not negatively impact existing revenue streams"
      rationale: "Protect core business while pursuing growth"
      # CUSTOMIZE: Add specific revenue protection requirements

    - id: B2
      type: goal
      statement: "[CUSTOMIZE: Primary success metric, e.g., 'Increase DAU by 15%']"
      rationale: "Primary KPI that defines feature success"

    - id: B3
      type: boundary
      statement: "Launch must occur within [CUSTOMIZE: Q3 2025] to meet business objectives"
      rationale: "Timeline tied to annual planning, competitive pressure, or market window"

    - id: B4
      type: goal
      statement: "Feature adoption target: [CUSTOMIZE: 60%] of eligible users within 30 days"
      rationale: "Adoption rate indicates product-market fit"

  technical:
    - id: T1
      type: boundary
      statement: "Engineering effort must not exceed [CUSTOMIZE: 2 sprints] of capacity"
      rationale: "Capacity constraint based on team availability and competing priorities"

    - id: T2
      type: invariant
      statement: "Must integrate with existing [CUSTOMIZE: authentication/payments/etc.] system"
      rationale: "Avoid duplicate infrastructure; leverage existing investments"

    - id: T3
      type: boundary
      statement: "Page load time must remain under [CUSTOMIZE: 3s] on mobile networks"
      rationale: "Performance regression would hurt overall user experience"

    - id: T4
      type: goal
      statement: "Reuse existing design system components where possible"
      rationale: "Faster development, consistent UX, reduced testing burden"

  user_experience:
    - id: U1
      type: invariant
      statement: "Must not break existing user workflows or learned behaviors"
      rationale: "Protect existing user satisfaction and reduce retraining burden"

    - id: U2
      type: boundary
      statement: "Core task must complete in [CUSTOMIZE: 3] clicks or fewer"
      rationale: "Simplicity drives adoption and satisfaction"

    - id: U3
      type: goal
      statement: "Target NPS improvement of [CUSTOMIZE: +5 points] post-launch"
      rationale: "User satisfaction metric tied to feature value"

    - id: U4
      type: goal
      statement: "Reduce user-reported friction by [CUSTOMIZE: 25%] for this workflow"
      rationale: "Addresses known pain points from user research"

  security:
    - id: S1
      type: invariant
      statement: "Must comply with [CUSTOMIZE: GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA] for user data handling"
      rationale: "Legal compliance is non-negotiable"

    - id: S2
      type: boundary
      statement: "Legal review must approve feature before public launch"
      rationale: "Mitigate regulatory and liability risks"

    - id: S3
      type: goal
      statement: "Minimize competitive exposure by [CUSTOMIZE: avoiding public preview]"
      rationale: "Protect competitive advantage until launch"

  operational:
    - id: O1
      type: invariant
      statement: "Support team must be trained before launch"
      rationale: "Poor support experience damages feature adoption and brand"

    - id: O2
      type: boundary
      statement: "Feature must support gradual rollout (feature flag)"
      rationale: "Risk mitigation through controlled release"

    - id: O3
      type: goal
      statement: "Dashboard ready for monitoring [CUSTOMIZE: key metrics] at launch"
      rationale: "Data-driven decision making requires observability"

    - id: O4
      type: goal
      statement: "Documentation and help content published before GA"
      rationale: "Self-service support reduces ticket volume"
