feature: secret-detection
outcome: "Secrets never leak into codebase through comprehensive detection at pre-commit, CI, and historical scanning layers"
phase: VERIFIED
created: "2026-01-28T00:00:00Z"

constraints:
  business:
    - id: B1
      description: "No secrets ever reach the main branch"
      type: invariant
      rationale: "Leaked secrets in version control persist forever and can be extracted from git history"

    - id: B2
      description: "Security scanning must not block release velocity unreasonably"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Security tools that slow developers too much get bypassed or disabled"

    - id: B3
      description: "Zero cost for basic secret detection tooling"
      type: boundary
      rationale: "Project uses free/open-source tools; no paid security services"

  technical:
    - id: T1
      description: "Pre-commit hook completes in < 5 seconds for staged files"
      type: boundary
      rationale: "Slow hooks frustrate developers and lead to --no-verify usage"

    - id: T2
      description: "CI security scan completes in < 3 minutes"
      type: boundary
      rationale: "Security checks should not dominate CI time; fast feedback loop"

    - id: T3
      description: "SARIF output for GitHub Security tab integration"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Centralized security findings in GitHub's native security dashboard"

    - id: T4
      description: "Support TypeScript/JavaScript codebase scanning"
      type: invariant
      rationale: "Project uses Bun + TypeScript; tools must understand this ecosystem"

    - id: T5
      description: "Gitleaks + Semgrep + TruffleHog tool stack"
      type: boundary
      rationale: "Selected for complementary strengths: regex (fast), SAST (deep), entropy (historical)"

  user_experience:
    - id: U1
      description: "Clear error messages when secrets detected locally"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Developers need actionable guidance on how to fix the issue"

    - id: U2
      description: "Graceful degradation if local tools not installed"
      type: invariant
      rationale: "Pre-commit should skip (not fail) if gitleaks missing; CI provides backstop"

    - id: U3
      description: "PR comments on detected secrets"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Inline feedback shows exactly where the problem is"

    - id: U4
      description: "Documentation for handling false positives"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Developers need clear process for allowlist management"

  security:
    - id: S1
      description: "Block PR merge when secrets detected in diff"
      type: invariant
      rationale: "Hard block is the only way to guarantee secrets never reach main"

    - id: S2
      description: "Scan entire git history weekly for existing leaks"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Detect secrets that entered before scanning was implemented"

    - id: S3
      description: "Include security audit rules beyond just secrets"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Semgrep p/security-audit catches SQL injection, XSS, etc."

    - id: S4
      description: "Allowlist mechanism for documented false positives"
      type: boundary
      rationale: "Must be able to exclude test fixtures, example placeholders"

    - id: S5
      description: "Detect 100+ secret types (AWS, GCP, GitHub, etc.)"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Gitleaks default ruleset covers major cloud providers and services"

  operational:
    - id: O1
      description: "Weekly historical scan with summary report"
      type: goal
      rationale: "TruffleHog entropy analysis finds secrets regex might miss"

    - id: O2
      description: "Manual workflow trigger for on-demand scanning"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Ability to run security scan without pushing code"

    - id: O3
      description: "Security findings visible in GitHub Actions summary"
      type: goal
      rationale: "Quick overview of scan results without digging through logs"

      type: boundary
      rationale: "Onboarding guide for tool installation and false positive handling"

tensions:
  - id: TN1
    type: trade_off
    status: resolved
    between: [T1, T2, S5]
    description: "Speed vs Comprehensive Detection"
    conflict: "Scanning 100+ secret patterns takes time; T1 requires < 5s local, T2 requires < 3min CI"
    options:
      A: "Staged-only local scanning - pre-commit scans only staged files (fast), CI scans full diff (thorough)"
      B: "Reduced rule count locally - minimal rules in pre-commit, full rules in CI"
      C: "Accept slower hooks - prioritize detection over speed, risk --no-verify bypass"
    decision: A
    resolution: "Pre-commit uses gitleaks --staged (only staged files, ~1-2s). CI runs full scan on diff. TruffleHog handles history weekly. Speed maintained without sacrificing coverage."

  - id: TN2
    type: trade_off
    status: resolved
    between: [S4, B1, S1]
    description: "Allowlist Mechanism vs Security Invariants"
    conflict: "Allowlist can bypass detection, potentially violating 'no secrets' invariant if abused"
    options:
      A: "Require rationale - each allowlist entry must have documented justification in .gitleaks.toml"
      B: "PR review required - changes to allowlist require explicit approval"
      C: "No allowlist - strictest approach, may cause friction with test fixtures"
    decision: A
    resolution: "Every allowlist entry in .gitleaks.toml must include comment explaining why it's a false positive. Code review catches suspicious additions. Balance security with practicality."

  - id: TN3
    type: trade_off
    status: resolved
    between: [U2, B1]
    description: "Graceful Degradation vs Protection Guarantee"
    conflict: "If local tools not installed, secrets could be committed. Does CI backstop maintain B1 invariant?"
    options:
      A: "CI backstop sufficient - CI always runs, local is convenience not requirement"
      B: "Warn loudly on skip - log prominent warning when local scan skips"
      C: "Require local tools - fail pre-commit if gitleaks not installed"
    decision: A
    resolution: "S1 (CI hard block) is the invariant that actually enforces B1. Local scanning is early feedback for developer convenience. Secrets are caught before merge regardless of local setup."

  - id: TN4
    type: hidden_dependency
    status: resolved
    between: [S1, T3]
    description: "PR Blocking Requires SARIF Integration"
    conflict: "To block PRs effectively, findings must appear in GitHub's native security flow"
    resolution: "Both gitleaks and semgrep must output SARIF format. GitHub Actions uses upload-sarif action to integrate with Security tab. This enables PR blocking via branch protection rules."

  - id: TN5
    type: resource_tension
    status: resolved
    between: [T5, B3]
    description: "Tool Stack vs Zero Cost"
    conflict: "Semgrep has optional paid features; must ensure free tier is sufficient"
    resolution: "All three tools (Gitleaks, Semgrep, TruffleHog) are fully functional in free/OSS mode. SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN is optional enhancement, not required. No paid services needed."
