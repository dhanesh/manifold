outcome: "Evaluate manifold for non-programming problem solving"
phase: "VERIFIED"
created: "2026-01-15"
context:
  motivation:
    - "Manifold was designed for software engineering constraints"
    - "Constraint-first thinking may apply to broader decision-making"
    - "Need to validate applicability beyond code"
  prior_art:
    - "Decision matrices and weighted scoring"
    - "Pro/con lists and Franklin squares"
    - "SWOT analysis for business decisions"
    - "Design thinking and jobs-to-be-done frameworks"
  success_metrics:
    - "Identify which constraint categories translate to non-programming"
    - "Document where the framework needs adaptation"
    - "Produce actionable recommendations for each domain"
constraints:
  business:
    - id: B1
      type: goal
      statement: "Evaluation must cover all 4 problem domains (business, personal, creative, research)"
      rationale: "Comprehensive validation requires testing across diverse problem types"

    - id: B2
      type: invariant
      statement: "Findings must be actionable, not just observational"
      rationale: "Goal is adaptations, not just a verdict"

    - id: B3
      type: goal
      statement: "Identify reusable patterns across domains"
      rationale: "Cross-domain applicability increases framework value"

  technical:
    - id: T1
      type: invariant
      statement: "Each domain must be tested with at least one hypothetical scenario"
      rationale: "Hypothetical testing chosen as evaluation method"

    - id: T2
      type: goal
      statement: "Constraint categories (B/T/U/S/O) must map to non-programming equivalents"
      rationale: "Core framework structure must translate or be adapted"

    - id: T3
      type: boundary
      statement: "Evaluation limited to constraint discovery and tension analysis phases"
      rationale: "Generate/verify phases are code-specific; focus on conceptual phases"

    - id: T4
      type: goal
      statement: "Document which /m commands are applicable vs need adaptation"
      rationale: "Actionable output for framework evolution"

  user_experience:
    - id: U1
      type: goal
      statement: "Non-technical users should understand the adapted framework"
      rationale: "Programming jargon may alienate non-developer users"

    - id: U2
      type: boundary
      statement: "Constraint discovery should take < 30 minutes per problem"
      rationale: "Complex decisions shouldn't require multi-hour sessions"

    - id: U3
      type: goal
      statement: "Output should aid decision-making, not just document constraints"
      rationale: "Practical value over theoretical completeness"

  security:
    - id: S1
      type: goal
      statement: "Personal decisions should allow private/local-only manifolds"
      rationale: "Life decisions may contain sensitive information"

    - id: S2
      type: boundary
      statement: "No personal data required for hypothetical scenarios"
      rationale: "Testing with hypotheticals avoids privacy concerns"

  operational:
    - id: O1
      type: goal
      statement: "Document template manifolds for each validated domain"
      rationale: "Reusable templates lower adoption barrier"

    - id: O2
      type: boundary
      statement: "Evaluation completable in single session"
      rationale: "Meta-evaluation shouldn't require multi-day effort"

    - id: O3
      type: goal
      statement: "Produce README section for non-programming use cases"
      rationale: "Findings should be documented for future users"
