## Tensions Identified

### TN1: Passion vs Market
- **Between**: G1 (write what I love) ↔ R1 (viable market)
- **Type**: Trade-off
- **Resolution**: Identify overlap between personal interests and healthy genres; don't chase trends but don't ignore market entirely

### TN2: Quality vs Timeline
- **Between**: G2 (publishable quality) ↔ F2 (12-month deadline)
- **Type**: Resource tension
- **Resolution**: First draft in 8 months, 4 months for revision; accept that first novel may need more editing

### TN3: Artistic Integrity vs Commercial Viability
- **Between**: R3 (artistic integrity) ↔ G3 (career foundation)
- **Type**: Trade-off
- **Resolution**: Write authentically but learn genre conventions; integrity doesn't mean ignoring craft

### TN4: Daily Output vs Quality
- **Between**: L1 (1,000 words/day) ↔ E1 (enjoyable process)
- **Type**: Hidden dependency
- **Resolution**: Flexible target - some days 500 words of quality beats 1,000 words of frustration

## Evaluation

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Constraint Discovery | ◐ Moderate | Framework helped but creative work is more fluid than structured |
| Tension Analysis | ✓ Strong | TN1 (passion vs market) is THE central creative tension |
| Decision Quality | ◐ Moderate | Framework useful for planning, less so for creative direction |
| Time Efficiency | ✓ Met | Completed in ~6 minutes |
| Terminology | ◐ Mostly | "Logistics" felt businesslike for creative work |

## Verdict

**Framework Applicability**: MODERATE

The framework is useful for the *planning* aspects of creative projects but less applicable to creative *direction* decisions. Tension analysis was valuable - it surfaced the fundamental passion-vs-market trade-off that every creative faces. However, the structured approach felt slightly at odds with the fluid nature of creative work.

**Recommendations**:
- Use for project planning and resource allocation
- Less useful for "what should I create?" decisions
- Consider softer category names for creative contexts: "Vision" instead of "Goals", "Reality" instead of "Feasibility"
