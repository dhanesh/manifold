# Research Documentation

Scientific foundations and academic research supporting the Manifold framework.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Phase Scientific Foundations](phase-scientific-foundations.md) | Maps each Manifold phase to supporting academic research |

## Overview

Manifold's design is grounded in research from multiple domains:

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** — Mathematical foundation for treating development as constraint satisfaction
- **Requirements Engineering** — Research on making implicit requirements explicit
- **Cognitive Science** — Backward planning studies from Psychological Science
- **Software Economics** — Shift-left cost curves and traceability ROI studies
- **Design Rationale** — Research on explicit trade-off documentation
- **Theory of Constraints** — Systems thinking for identifying bottlenecks

## Key Findings

| Research Area | Key Finding | Impact on Manifold |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Backward Planning | Clearer step anticipation, better outcomes | `/m3-anchor` phase design |
| Traceability | 24% faster, 50% more correct | Artifact traceability requirement |
| Shift-Left | 10-100x cost reduction | Early constraint discovery |
| Design Rationale | Higher quality from explicit reasoning | `/m2-tension` phase design |
